# intro_to_R

This repository contains exercises for the introduction to R class of the Master in Economics of Ecole Polytechnique and the Master Data and Public Policy of ENSAE Paris.

It is mostly a translation of Lino Galiana's introduction to R (written in French) with a few changes here and there. You can find Lino's class [here](https://rgeo.linogaliana.fr/).
